My Journey in MLOps
##  Model-Centric vs Data-Centric AI

Traditional ML focused on improving models. But in MLOps, better performance often comes from improving data — not just the model.

|                    | Model-Centric Approach                         | Data-Centric Approach                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|  Focus           | Improve the model (architecture, parameters)  | Improve the data (quality, quantity)         |
|  Example Issue   | Stuck at 75% accuracy                          | Model can’t learn well from noisy data       |
|  Problem         | Changing models doesn’t help much              | Dirty/incomplete data limits performance     |
|  Solution        | Try a better algorithm                         | Clean and expand the dataset                 |
|  Result          | Small performance gain                         | Big performance gain (90%+ accuracy)         |

>  Data-Centric AI = Better performance through better data

Better data → Better model performance → More reliable ML systems in production.
